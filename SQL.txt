1. what is SQL?
	Structured query language (SQL) is a programming language for storing and processing information in a
	 relational database.

2.keyfeatures of SQL:
	a. Data Definition Language (DDL): 
		SQL provides a set of commands to define and modify the structure of a database, including creating tables, 
		modifying table structure, and dropping tables.
	b. Data Manipulation Language (DML): 
		SQL provides a set of commands to manipulate data within a database, including adding, modifying, and deleting 
		data.
	c. Query Language: 
		SQL provides a rich set of commands for querying a database to retrieve data, including the ability to filter,
		 sort, group, and join data from multiple tables.
	d. Transaction Control: 
		SQL supports transaction processing, which allows users to group a set of database operations into a single 
		transaction that can be rolled back in case of failure.
	e. Data Integrity: 
		SQL includes features to enforce data integrity, such as the ability to specify constraints on the values that 
		can be inserted or updated in a table, and to enforce referential integrity between tables.
	f. User Access Control: 
		SQL provides mechanisms to control user access to a database, including the ability to grant and revoke 
		privileges to perform certain operations on the database.
	g. Portability: 
		SQL is a standardized language, meaning that SQL code written for one database management system can be used on
		 another system with minimal modification.

3. common use case of SQL.
	a. Data Science & Analytics: 
		Used for querying large datasets, data cleaning, and analysis. Analysts use SQL to generate reports and insights
		 that inform business decisions.
	b. Machine Learning & AI: 
		Helps in preparing and managing the data required for training machine learning models and AI algorithms. 
		It is used for data cleaning, transformation, and extraction.
	c. Web Development: 
		Used to manage user data, e-commerce transactions, and content management in websites and applications built
		 with frameworks like Django, Node.js, and Ruby on Rails.
	d. Cloud and Big Data: 
		SQL is integrated into cloud-based databases (e.g., Amazon RDS, Microsoft Azure SQL) and Big Data platforms 
		(e.g., Apache Hive) to enable seamless data querying and management.
	e. Blockchain and Decentralized Systems: 
		In blockchain systems, SQL can be used to manage off-chain data, providing efficient data storage and retrieval
		 alongside decentralized ledger technology.
